          Anything you're passionate about, really. The talks don't have to be technical (but they
          certainly can be). The most important thing is that you're excited about your topic.
          That's the amazing thing about public speaking - you get to share your passions with the
          world. Just keep in mind that all talks must follow our{' '}

        <Panel heading="How long should my talk be?" id="length">
          At every event, we plan to have a mix of longer 20-25 minute talks and 5-10 minute
          lightning talks. So do whatever you feel most comfortable with! If you need more time to
          present, please let us know so we can adjust the schedule or coordinate with the venue.

        <Panel heading="What if the lineup for the location I want to speak at is full?" id="contention">
          It's very, very likely that if we host a QueerJS in a city, we'll do it again in the same
          city one day. So we'd still encourage you to submit your talk. That way, you'll be at the
          top of the list for the next edition!
        </Panel>
        <Panel heading="Can you pay for my flights? ">
          Actually, there's a good chance that we can if you're coming from a reasonable distance
          (total cost is less than 200 EUR). If you'd like to speak at an upcoming meetup and need
          travel assistance for any reason, please mention it in your talk proposal and we'll let
          you know if it's possible.
        </Panel>
        <Panel heading="What's the talk selection process?" id="talk-selection">
          Talk slots are first come, first served (for the most part). After you open your issue,
          one of the organizers will reach out and let you know the next steps!

        <Panel heading="How should I prepare for an online talk?" id="online-meetup-prep">
          There are several things to consider with an online talk.
          
          <p>Do you want to present live the audience, or pre-record your talk? Each have benefits and drawbacks but the choice is up to you.</p>
          
          <dl>
            <dt>Live presentation</dt>
            <dd>This is the best way to engage with your audience. Be wary that the stream may be delayed by a minute or more, so you will need to be creative with how you engage folks. You are welcome to post polls/games to the Twitch chat, for instance.</dd>
            <dt>Pre-recorded stream</dt>
            <dd>This is the best way to ensure your recording & technical setup is perfect. If you want to take this route, please provide a high quality mp4 before the meetup and the streamer will queue it for you. You will still be able to participate in Q&amp;A afterward.</dd>
          </dl>
          
          <p>At the end of your talk we will include a Q&amp;A session with the MC via Zoom, which will include any questions and comments from the audience. If you want to opt out of this, please let us know.</p>
          
          <p>Technical considerations:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>We use Skype for the livestream. If you want to call an organizer to get comfortable with the features, get in touch!</li>
            <li>Ensure your technical set up is ready ahead of time. We will run a quick test of this before the stream.</li>
            <li>*For Mac*: ensure Skype has permission to record your screen. To do this, open Settings &raquo; Security &amp; Privacy &raquo; check "Skype"</li>
