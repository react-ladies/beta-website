          Involvement might include working with your employers to provide a space, organizing
          catering for meetup attendees, ensuring that there is a livestream or opportunity to
          record the speakers, and generally working to ensure that the meetup runs smoothly.

          Local organizers are the point people for any given QueerJS event, and are key to its success.
          If you would like to be a local organizer, you should be prepared to:
          <ul>
            <li> Take point on finding a venue and date to hold the event. </li>
            <li> Ensure there is adequate seating for the RSVP'd number of attendees at the selected venue. </li>
            <li> Coordinate recording of event (and individual speakers) with onsite hosts, if possible. </li>
            <li> Coordinate food with onsite hosts, which may either be:
              <ul>
                <li> Provided by onsite hosts </li>
                <li> Ordered by local organizer and reimbursed through QueerJS' {' '}
